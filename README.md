### Introduction ###
This project consists in applying Evolutionary Computation techniques 
to Conway's Game of Life (or simply LIFE) in order to generate game entities that move across the game board
in a specific way (eg. spaceships).

### Files: ###
- `main.py`     Main script that performs evolution
- `life.py`     Module that contains part of LIFE implementation
- `lifecore`    C++ written executable that performs LIFE game execution, ___Source files will be added soon___ .

### External modules required ###
- `pylab`
- `numpy`
- `inspyred`

### How to run evolution ###
Make sure to have Python version 3 installed.  
Run:  
`python main.py`
