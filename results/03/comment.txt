Parameters tuned
Mainly mutation rate was increased from 0.2 to 0.7 and replacement was changed
to plus strategy


# Best individual Performance #
final_distance: 0.0
final_size: 9.0
iterations: 79.0


IDEA:
Great mutation rate is better
Standard comma replacement is excluded as elitism is crucial.
Plus replacement is nice but it can be one of the reasons why the evolution
seems to get stuck in a local minimum
It could be better to use generational replacement with more than 2 elites
