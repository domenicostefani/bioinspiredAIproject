The first glider created from the start!
Why this happened?
This could be from the fact that by introducing custom operators, especially
resetrandom_mutation and some of the crossover ops, we allow the system to
explore sparse configurations with few alive cells.

IDEA: I could implement a mutator operator that performs one iteration of life
